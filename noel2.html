				<p>The image above is a sketch portraying the effect of social media on politics, and the poem I made about it.
				The image was made to show that we connect to each other in multiple ways using social media, but people can be very ignorant on social media when it comes to politics. 
				I chose this topic "Social Media and Politics because a lot of people speak their minds openly on these platforms, especially our current president, Donald J. Trunp </p>

			<div class="center">
				<p>The image above somewhat portrays child labor, and also portrays my poem. The image shows a "child" with a portion of his body a skeleton, showing that the factories have been tearing him apart. 
				The factories have "people/children" walking inside, and you can see the names of the factories. "The Man" shows it is controlled by someone higher up, while corportation shows even when it is a big company, many children had to work for their families. 
				Underneath the main "child", there are "souls" of the childhood these workers lost.</p>
